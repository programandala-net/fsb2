== Description

fsb2 is a preprocessor and converter of Forth source files,
written in Forth.  Its goal is to make it easy to edit and
mantain Forth source files, in ordinary text format, for Forth
systems that use blocks files.

Following some simple layout conventions, the source file can be
edited without the lack of space imposed by blocks, thus making
it possible to include detailed comments and arrange a clear
layout.

fsb2's web page:
http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb2.html.

== Origin and motivation

fsb2 was written as a faster and simpler alternative to a
previous project of the author,
http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb.html[fsb], which is
written in Vim.

fsb and fsb2 do the same: they convert the same source format
and provide the same target formats.
But there are some differences:

- fsb is much slower.
- fsb recognizes three directives: `#previm`, `#vim` and `#trace`.
- fsb allows comments and code at the right of a
  backslash-format block header.
- fsb removes the source filename extension from the target
  filename.

fsb and fsb2 can be installed at the same time.

== Requirements

fsb2 has been written for Gforth and tested only with Gforth.
Probably the changes required to run on any other standard Forth
system are very simple. This task is on the to-do list.

- http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/[Gforth]

- http://irdvo.github.io/ffl/[Forth Foundation Library]

- Some additional converters have specific requirements. See
  their source code (the files with the ".sh" filename
  extension).

fsb2 can run on any platform Gforth can run on, and convert
files from the FSB format to FB or FBS formats (see below). But
the other converters, provided only as shell files, run only on
GNU/Linux or other flavours of Unix.

== Forth source filename extensions

The filename extensions used by fsb2 are derived from ".fs" and
".fb", used by Gforth and other Forth systems.

|===
| Extension | Description

| .fs       | Forth stream file.
| .fsb      | Forth stream file with blocks-like layout.
| .fb       | Forth blocks file.
| .fbs      | Forth blocks file with stream-like end-of-lines.

== The FBS format

FBS is the name fsb2 uses for a _target format_ it can convert
FSB sources to. FBS files are blocks files but with 63-chars
lines and end of lines.  This is the format used by the library
of the lina Forth system.

== The FSB format

fsb2 uses an ad-hoc simple format for Forth source, called FSB.
The ".fsb" filename extension is used.  FSB files are ordinary
text files with only three simple layout conventions: block
headers, metacomments and empty lines.

=== Block headers

Block headers must be marked with a comment. There are three
ways to do it:

1. A paren comment that starts at the first column of the line.
2. A backslash comment that starts at the first columen of the line
*and* ends with a second closing slash. This alternative is
provided in order to include words with closing parens.
3. A dot-paren comment that starts at the first column of the line.

More comments or Forth code can be included after the header
comment, except when using the backslash comment header.

Examples:

----
( Tools)

    \ this is block 0

.( More tools) \ anything is allowed here

    \ this is block 1

( MAIN-WORD ) page

    \ this is block 2

\ (CORE) \

    \ this is block 3

    \ Note: nothing is allowed
    \ on the header line at the right
    \ of the ending backslash.

----

The only header comment that is not necessary is the first one,
for block 0. When there is something (except metacomments, see
below) at the top of the file, it's suppossed to be the
contents of the first block.  Example:

----
\ This is block 0,
\ even without an actual block header.

: bla  ( -- )  recurse  ;

( More )

\ This is block 1.
----

=== Metacomments

Metacomments are comments that will be removed from the target
file.  They are backslash comments that are on their own line
and have at least one space on the left.

----
( block header )

\ This comment will be preserved.

variable range \ this comment will be preserved as well

  \ But all these comments
  \ will be removed
  \ from the target file.

----

=== Empty lines

All empty lines are ignored and will be removed during the
conversion.

== Command line options

----

Usage: fsb2 [ OPTION | INPUT-FILE ] ...

  -?, --help    show this help
      --version show version info
  -v, --verbose activate verbose mode
  -b, --fb      convert to FB format (default)
  -s, --fbs     convert to FBS format
  -l, --lines   set the lines per block (default 16)
  -c, --columns set the columns per line (default 64)
  -d, --debug   activate debugging mode (output to the screen)
----

== Example

The included file <test.fsb> can be used for testing:

----
# convert test.fsb to test.fsb.fb:
fsb2 test.fsb

# convert test.fsb to test.fsb.fbs:
fsb2 --fbs test.fsb
----

== Additional converters

Several additional converters are provided as shell files (with
the ".sh" filename extension). They are specific to ZX Spectrum
Forth systems, but may be used as a model for other systems.

fsb2-abersoft :: ZX Spectrum TAP file for the original unfixed
Abersoft Forth (one file called "DISC", with 11 1-KiB screens,
but 11263 bytes instead of 11264).

fsb2-abersoft11k :: ZX Spectrum TAP file for Abersoft Forth fixed
by the Afera library (one file called "DISC", with 11 1-KiB
screens, 11264 bytes).

fsb2-abersoft16k :: ZX Spectrum TAP file for Abersoft Forth
improved by the Afera library (one file called "DISC", with 16
1-KiB screens).

fsb2-mgt :: ZX Spectrum MGT file (disk image for GDOS, G+DOS or
Beta DOS), with the Forth source saved on the sectors.

fsb2-tap :: ZX Spectrum TAP file (tape), for any ZX Spectrum
Forth.
